              "Tier Equivalent Minimum Items" in the picture mean Tier
              Equivalent Minimum, for example if there is a T7 Grovekeeper in

              above). If there is a T6 Cape, you can wear 4.2, 5.1, 6.0 and
              above. T8 is 5.3, 6.2, 7.1, 8.0 and etc. (5 + 3 = 8, 6 + 2 = 8

            <h3>Approved Roles</h3>
            <p>
              We are now enforcing Approved Roles for certain builds in our
              zerg. Without this role, you'll have to pick something else to
              play. These roles are also limited in the zerg, so be mindful that
              you'll need to flex other roles.
